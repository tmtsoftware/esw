# Location Service

The Location Service DSL is a wrapper over the Location Service module provided by CSW.
You can refer the detailed documentation of the Location Service provided by CSW @extref[here](csw:services/location).

This DSL provides the following APIs:

## register

This DSL registers a provided `Registration` with the Location Service and returns a `RegistrationResult`, which contains the `Location` with which a component is registered and a handle for un-registration.

@extref[Registration](csw_scaladoc:csw/location/api/models/Registration) can be one of:

1. @extref[AkkaRegistration](csw_scaladoc:csw/location/api/models/AkkaRegistration)
1. @extref[HttpRegistration](csw_scaladoc:csw/location/api/models/HttpRegistration)
1. @extref[TcpRegistration](csw_scaladoc:csw/location/api/models/TcpRegistration)

Kotlin
:   @@snip [LocationServiceDslExample.kts](../../../../../../examples/src/main/kotlin/esw/ocs/scripts/examples/paradox/LocationServiceDslExample.kts) { #register }

## unregister

This DSL un-registers the provided `Connection` from Location Service

@extref[Connection](csw_scaladoc:csw/location/api/models/Connection) can be one of:

1. @extref[AkkaConnection](csw_scaladoc:csw/location/api/models/Connection$$AkkaConnection)
1. @extref[HttpConnection](csw_scaladoc:csw/location/api/models/Connection$$HttpConnection)
1. @extref[TcpConnection](csw_scaladoc:csw/location/api/models/Connection$$TcpConnection)

Kotlin
:   @@snip [LocationServiceDslExample.kts](../../../../../../examples/src/main/kotlin/esw/ocs/scripts/examples/paradox/LocationServiceDslExample.kts) { #unregister }

## findLocation

This DSL looks up the provided `Connection` in the Location Service and returns the corresponding `Location`, or `null`, if not found.

Kotlin
:   @@snip [LocationServiceDslExample.kts](../../../../../../examples/src/main/kotlin/esw/ocs/scripts/examples/paradox/LocationServiceDslExample.kts) { #find-location }

## resolveLocation

This DSL looks for the specified `Connection` in the Location Service for the optionally specified duration (default is 5 seconds) and returns the corresponding `Location`.
If the location is not resolved within the time limit, `null` is returned.

Kotlin
:   @@snip [LocationServiceDslExample.kts](../../../../../../examples/src/main/kotlin/esw/ocs/scripts/examples/paradox/LocationServiceDslExample.kts) { #resolve-location }

## listLocations

Lists all the locations currently registered with the Location Service.

Kotlin
:   @@snip [LocationServiceDslExample.kts](../../../../../../examples/src/main/kotlin/esw/ocs/scripts/examples/paradox/LocationServiceDslExample.kts) { #list-locations }

## listLocationsBy

The following various APIs are provided for listing locations with filtering criteria:

### @extref[ComponentType](csw_scaladoc:csw/location/api/models/ComponentType)

Filters locations based on provided `ComponentType`.  A DSL is provided to specify the type, which can be one of:
`HCD`, `Assembly`, `Sequencer`, `SequenceComponent`, `Container`, `Service`

The following example demonstrates a use case where the script sends an Offline command to all of the Assemblies currently registered.

Kotlin
:   @@snip [LocationServiceDslExample.kts](../../../../../../examples/src/main/kotlin/esw/ocs/scripts/examples/paradox/LocationServiceDslExample.kts) { #list-locations-by-comp-type }

### @extref[ConnectionType](csw_scaladoc:csw/location/api/models/ConnectionType)

Filters locations based on provided `ConnectionType`. A DSL is provided to specify the type, which can be one of:
`AkkaType`, `HttpType`, `TcpType`.

The following example demonstrates a use case where the script locks all the Akka Type components i.e. Assemblies and HCD's.

Kotlin
:   @@snip [LocationServiceDslExample.kts](../../../../../../examples/src/main/kotlin/esw/ocs/scripts/examples/paradox/LocationServiceDslExample.kts) { #list-locations-by-connection-type }

@@@ note { title="Required import for Location Service APIs"}

The following import is required for using `ConnectionType` and `ComponentType`:

```kotlin
import esw.ocs.dsl.highlevel.models.*
```

### Hostname

Filters locations based on the provided hostname (or IP address).

In the following example, all the components running on `IRIS` (hostname: **10.1.1.1**) machine are listed.

Kotlin
:   @@snip [LocationServiceDslExample.kts](../../../../../../examples/src/main/kotlin/esw/ocs/scripts/examples/paradox/LocationServiceDslExample.kts) { #list-locations-by-hostname }

### Prefix

Filters locations based on the provided prefix string.  As with the CSW Location Service, the method filters for all 
locations with prefixes that start with the provided string.

In the following example, it receives a list of all the components registered with prefixes that start with: `IRIS.filter.`

Kotlin
:   @@snip [LocationServiceDslExample.kts](../../../../../../examples/src/main/kotlin/esw/ocs/scripts/examples/paradox/LocationServiceDslExample.kts) { #list-locations-by-prefix }

## onLocationTrackingEvent

This DSL allows you to add a callback that is called when the location of the specified connection changes, which is represented by a `TrackingEvent`.

@extref[TrackingEvent](csw_scaladoc:csw/location/api/models/TrackingEvent) has following two subclasses

1. @extref[LocationUpdated](csw_scaladoc:csw/location/api/models/LocationUpdated): Published when the location is registered with the Location Service

1. @extref[LocationRemoved](csw_scaladoc:csw/location/api/models/LocationRemoved): Published when the location is removed from the Location Service

Kotlin
:   @@snip [LocationServiceDslExample.kts](../../../../../../examples/src/main/kotlin/esw/ocs/scripts/examples/paradox/LocationServiceDslExample.kts) { #on-location-tracking-event }

@@@ note

`sendUIEvent` used in above examples is just for demonstration purposes and is not part of DSL.
The `sendUIEvent` method, defined elsewhere in the script, publishes a `SystemEvent` with the provided message.
