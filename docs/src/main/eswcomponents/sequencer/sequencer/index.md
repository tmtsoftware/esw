# Sequence Components and Sequencers

Sequencers are OMOA components and must therefore contain the same basic functionality expected of all OMOA components. 
This includes:

* Supporting the component lifecycle.
* Registering itself in the Location Service.
* Using CSW to communicate with other components.

The core of each Sequencer is a Sequence Component, a reusable framework component which is 
used to construct a Sequencer as an OMOA component.

The following sections provide details on the Sequence Component and Sequencer.
