/**
 * This file is created with intention to keep all timeouts used in esw at one place.
 * Timeouts are grouped in separately according to their usages. For example,
 *
 * [[AgentTimeouts]] contain timeouts that are used by the agent APIs.
 *
 * [[CommonTimeouts]] contain timeouts that are commonly used more than one services.
 *
 * Some timeouts are composed from multiple other timeouts. For example,
 * {{{val timeout1: FiniteDuration = timeout2 + timeout3}}}
 * In such cases we have added a requirement that puts an upper bound on the resulting timeout
 * so that it does not exceed some fixed amount of time when the underlying timeouts change:
 * {{{require(timeout1 <= x.seconds)}}}
