# Releasing

## Prerequisites (This is already configured in `release.yml`)

* Git authentication works by running cmd: `ssh -vT git@github.com`
* Node is installed
* npm module `junit-merge` is installed (for merging multiple xml test reports into one)
* npm module `junit-viewer` is installed (for generating html test report from merged xml)

## Steps to release

### Release Dependent Repos

Refer RELEASING.md in `msocket`
Refer RELEASING.md in `embedded-keycloak`
Refer RELEASING.md in `sbt-docs`
Refer RELEASING.md in `kotlin-plugin`
Refer RELEASING.md in `csw`

### Versioning Strategy

TMT work packages are released in incrementally. (M1 -> RC -> Final)
A milestone release is cut from master branch as we expect bug fixes / feedback before making the final release.
1. While making `Milestone(M*)` release, we follow these ideas:
- Update transitive dependencies.
- Important bug fixes that we want in the major release.
2. While making `RC-*` release, we follow :
- We cut a branch from master, any changes on master from here onwards will not be considered for this current release.
- Do not update any third party dependencies.
  If Secondary packages has some changes after M1 Release of ESW, we update them & use their latest tags.
  These secondary packages include `msocket`, `sbt-docs`, `kotlin-plugin` & `embedded-keycloak`.
- Documentation related updates are allowed on this RC branch, because these changes won't be breaking anything code-wise.
3. While making `Final` release, we follow:
- RC branch will be considered final & not the master branch.
- After getting the approval, `V*.*.*` tag will be created.

### ESW

1. Create a branch named `branch-<major>.<minor>.x` if not already exists from `master`. Example branch name `branch-3.0.x`.
   All subsequent release for this release cycle should be done on this branch. All further steps are to be done on this branch.
2. Update release notes (`notes/<version>.markdown`)
    **Note** - The version in `notes` should be of format `1.0.0`
3. Update top-level `CHANGELOG.md`
4. Update top-level `README.md`
5. Update versions in `release.yml'` for other repos like `CSW_VERSION`, `ESW_OCS_ENG_UI_VERSION` etc. which we will be releasing next. (These versions are used to create parameterized links in the documentation)
6. Update latest RTM version in github and jenkins workflow files(this step to be done only in milestone & RC release).
7. Add changes mention in `CHANGELOG.md` of `esw-contract` in top-level `CHANGELOG.md`
8. Add changes mention in `CHANGELOG.md` of `esw-contract` in the change section of `README.md` of `esw-contract`
9. Exclude projects from `build.sbt` which you do not want to release
10. Update dependent repo version in `Libs.scala`
11. Run command `headerCheckAll` inside sbt to verify if there are files without copyright header.
12. Commit and push the changes to `branch-<major>.<minor>.x` branch and make sure build is green for dev and paradox link pipeline.
13. Make sure build is green for dev and paradox link check pipeline for this branch.
14. Run `release.sh $VERSION$` script by providing version number argument (This triggers release workflow)
15. Applicable for final release only - Upgrade all the versions of all esw apps in [here](https://github.com/tmtsoftware/osw-apps/blob/master/apps.json)

     **Note:** `PROD=true` environment variable needs to be set before running `release.sh`
